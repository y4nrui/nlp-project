        "It almost seems like Donald Trump is trolling America at this point. In the beginning, when he tried to gaslight the country by insisting that the crowd at his inauguration was the biggest ever   or that it was even close to the last couple of inaugurations   we all kind of scratched our heads and wondered what kind of bullshit he was playing at. Then when he started appointing people to positions they had no business being in, we started to worry that this was going to go much worse than we had expected.After 11 months of Donald Trump pulling the rhetorical equivalent of whipping his dick out and slapping it on every table he gets near, I think it s time we address what s happening: Dude is a straight-up troll. He gets pleasure out of making other people uncomfortable or even seeing them in distress. He actively thinks up ways to piss off people he doesn t like.Let s set aside just for a moment the fact that that s the least presidential  behavior anyone s ever heard of   it s dangerous.His latest stunt is one of the grossest yet.Everyone is, by now, used to Trump not talking about things he doesn t want to talk about, and making a huge deal out of things that not many people care about. So it wasn t a huge surprise when the president didn t discuss the Sandy Hook shooting of 2012 on the fifth anniversary of that tragic event. What was a huge surprise was that he not only consciously decided not to invite the victims  families to the White House Christmas party this year   as they have been invited every year since the massacre took place, along with others who share those concerns.In each of the past 4 years, President Obama invited gun violence prevention activists, gun violence survivors (including the Sandy Hook families) and supportive lawmakers to his Christmas party. Zero gun lobbyists were in attendance. pic.twitter.com/QePW9FtbSh  Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) December 15, 2017The last sentence of that tweet is important, because that s exactly who Donald Trump did invite to the White House Christmas party. Instead of victims. On the anniversary day.Yesterday was the 5 year mark of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook School, which went unacknowledged by the President. On the same day, he hosted a White House Christmas party to which he invited @NRA CEO Wayne LaPierre. Here he is at the party with @DanPatrick. pic.twitter.com/mUbKCIWGxB  Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) December 15, 2017Wayne LaPierre is the man who, in response to the Sandy Hook massacre, finally issued a statement that blamed gun violence on music, movies, and video games, and culminated with perhaps the greatest bit of irony any man has ever unintentionally conceived of: Isn t fantasizing about killing people as a way to get your kicks really the filthiest form of pornography? Yes. Yes, it is, Wayne.Anyway, Happy Holidays Merry Christmas from Donald Trump, everyone!Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images\n",

        "Good news everyone! All crime in Texas has been solved. How do we know this? Because Fort Bend County Sheriff Troy E. Nehls has announced that he s going on a crusade against protected political speech.Apparently, the Sheriff saw someone s anti-Trump sticker he placed on his truck and decided to take action pleasing the tortured little snowflakes who contacted him about it but also showing that not only he but an unnamed prosecutor is corrupt as f*ck. I have received numerous calls regarding the offensive display on this truck as it is often seen along FM 359. If you know who owns this truck or it is yours, I would like to discuss it with you,  the Sheriff posted on Facebook Wednesday.  Our Prosecutor has informed us she would accept Disorderly Conduct charges regarding it, but I feel we could come to an agreement regarding a modification to it. Yes, disorderly conduct. For a sticker. Because it s anti-Trump.Sorry, Sheriff. No  agreement  is necessary, as it is not a crime to criticize the President or people who voted for him. Naturally, Americans stopped by to laugh at the sheriff who claims that saying mean things about Trump constitutes an  immediate breach of the peace :       Unfortunately for the Sheriff, this matter was decided in the 1971 Supreme Court case, Cohen v. California. A man was convicted for disturbing the peace by wearing a  f*ck the draft  jacket, but the Supreme Court told those who would abuse the justice system by punishing protected political speech to f*ck off.Unfortunately, the goal here isn t to successfully prosecute someone. It s to make sure that the owner of the truck pays for being mean to Trump.Featured image via screengrab\n",

            "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of a conservative Republican faction in the U.S. Congress, who voted this month for a huge expansion of the national debt to pay for tax cuts, called himself a “fiscal conservative” on Sunday and urged budget restraint in 2018. In keeping with a sharp pivot under way among Republicans, U.S. Representative Mark Meadows, speaking on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” drew a hard line on federal spending, which lawmakers are bracing to do battle over in January. When they return from the holidays on Wednesday, lawmakers will begin trying to pass a federal budget in a fight likely to be linked to other issues, such as immigration policy, even as the November congressional election campaigns approach in which Republicans will seek to keep control of Congress. President Donald Trump and his Republicans want a big budget increase in military spending, while Democrats also want proportional increases for non-defense “discretionary” spending on programs that support education, scientific research, infrastructure, public health and environmental protection. “The (Trump) administration has already been willing to say: ‘We’re going to increase non-defense discretionary spending ... by about 7 percent,’” Meadows, chairman of the small but influential House Freedom Caucus, said on the program. “Now, Democrats are saying that’s not enough, we need to give the government a pay raise of 10 to 11 percent. For a fiscal conservative, I don’t see where the rationale is. ... Eventually you run out of other people’s money,” he said. Meadows was among Republicans who voted in late December for their party’s debt-financed tax overhaul, which is expected to balloon the federal budget deficit and add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt. “It’s interesting to hear Mark talk about fiscal responsibility,” Democratic U.S. Representative Joseph Crowley said on CBS. Crowley said the Republican tax bill would require the  United States to borrow $1.5 trillion, to be paid off by future generations, to finance tax cuts for corporations and the rich. “This is one of the least ... fiscally responsible bills we’ve ever seen passed in the history of the House of Representatives. I think we’re going to be paying for this for many, many years to come,” Crowley said. Republicans insist the tax package, the biggest U.S. tax overhaul in more than 30 years,  will boost the economy and job growth. House Speaker Paul Ryan, who also supported the tax bill, recently went further than Meadows, making clear in a radio interview that welfare or “entitlement reform,” as the party often calls it, would be a top Republican priority in 2018. In Republican parlance, “entitlement” programs mean food stamps, housing assistance, Medicare and Medicaid health insurance for the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as other programs created by Washington to assist the needy. Democrats seized on Ryan’s early December remarks, saying they showed Republicans would try to pay for their tax overhaul by seeking spending cuts for social programs. But the goals of House Republicans may have to take a back seat to the Senate, where the votes of some Democrats will be needed to approve a budget and prevent a government shutdown. Democrats will use their leverage in the Senate, which Republicans narrowly control, to defend both discretionary non-defense programs and social spending, while tackling the issue of the “Dreamers,” people brought illegally to the country as children. Trump in September put a March 2018 expiration date on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which protects the young immigrants from deportation and provides them with work permits. The president has said in recent Twitter messages he wants funding for his proposed Mexican border wall and other immigration law changes in exchange for agreeing to help the Dreamers. Representative Debbie Dingell told CBS she did not favor linking that issue to other policy objectives, such as wall funding. “We need to do DACA clean,” she said.  On Wednesday, Trump aides will meet with congressional leaders to discuss those issues. That will be followed by a weekend of strategy sessions for Trump and Republican leaders on Jan. 6 and 7, the White House said. Trump was also scheduled to meet on Sunday with Florida Republican Governor Rick Scott, who wants more emergency aid. The House has passed an $81 billion aid package after hurricanes in Florida, Texas and Puerto Rico, and wildfires in California. The package far exceeded the $44 billion requested by the Trump administration. The Senate has not yet voted on the aid. \n"

            "SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia s Bureau of Statistics said on Tuesday 9.2 million people, or 57.5 percent of eligible voters, have cast their votes in a ballot on whether same-sex marriage should be legalized. Australians began voting last month in the non-binding poll, conducted by post, to inform the government on whether voters wanted Australia to become the 25th nation to permit same-sex marriage. The results of the poll will be declared on Nov. 15. The first official update suggests a high turnout is likely despite the ballot being non-compulsory. Turnout levels will go a long way in determining whether Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull can finally resolve a topic that has dogged his tenure as leader and threatened to split his centre-right government along ideological grounds. Low turnout would have seen the issue continue to dominate the political discourse whatever the result, underpinned by  questions of legitimacy in a country used to compulsory voting. The first official update on the progress of the same-sex marriage survey comes just a day after a Sky News ReachTel poll showed the  yes  vote on track for a comprehensive victory. More than 64 percent of those surveyed have sent back their ballot and voted  yes , the poll showed, with a further six percent planning to support same-sex marriage.   A widespread victory may do little, however, to heal a divided the nation of 24 million people, which has split along religious and generational lines and at times has threatened to turn nasty, prompting parliament to strengthen laws preventing hate-speech. \n"
